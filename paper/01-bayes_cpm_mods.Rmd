<!-- ## Background -->

<!-- mini lit review for ordinal models and summarizing results of previous continuous CPM papers -->

Cumulative models for ordinal outcomes -- traditionally denoted cumulative link models [@agresti_categorical_2002] -- have been discussed extensively in the literature using both classical (frequentist) and Bayesian implementations. Since these models are characterized by adding probabilities, not link functions, we prefer the nomenclature cumulative probability model (CPM). Under the frequentist paradigm, Walker and Duncan [@walker_estimation_1967] and McCullagh [@peter_mccullagh_regression_1980] described these models as an extension of dichotomous outcome regression models: logistic and probit regression are most well-known examples. A Bayesian CPM for ordinal regression was first detailed by Albert and Chib [@albert_bayesian_1993; @albert_bayesian_1997] and Johnson and Albert [@johnson_ordinal_1999]. <!--Peng and Hall [cite] describe a Bayesian approach to generalized ordinal regression models for rating data --> Additional Bayesian CPM extensions including partial proportional odds [@peterson_partial_1990], mixture link models [@lang_bayesian_1999], location-scale ordinal regression [citation] and multivariate ordinal outcomes are described by Congdon [@congdon_bayesian_2005]. In all these settings, the number of ordered outcome categories is implicitly assumed to be smaller -- often much smaller -- than the sample size. However, continuous data are also ordinal and can therefore be fit using CPMs.

In the continuous data setting, Liu et al. [@liu_modeling_2017] demonstrate the equivalence between CPMs and transformation models of the form:
\begin{equation}
Y=H(\beta^{T}X+\varepsilon) \quad \text{where} \quad \varepsilon \sim F_{\varepsilon}
\end{equation}
where $H(\cdot)$ is an increasing function, $\beta$ a vector of regression coefficients, $X$ a vector of covariates, and $\varepsilon$ are errors distributed according to $F_{\varepsilon}$. Following Zeng and Lin [], Harrell [@harrell_regression_2015] and Liu et al. [@liu_modeling_2017] describe approximate non-parametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE)
for the unspecified transformation $H(\cdot)$ and $\beta$ parameters. The models have several favorable characteristics including invariance of regression coefficient estimates to monotonic outcome transformations and ability to handle mixed continuous and discrete outcomes such as those that arise from a lower or upper limit of detection. In addition CPMs directly model the full conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF); this allows estimates of conditional means, quantiles, and exceedance probabilities to be calculated from a single model fit. Further, because only the $H(\cdot)$ part of the model is nonparametric, CPMs are semiparametric regression models which balance the robustness of fully nonparametric models and the efficiency of fully parametric models.

There is an extensive literature on Bayesian semiparametric regression models. The aim -- stated by Gelfand [@gelfand_approaches_1999] in his discussion of general approaches for these models -- is, ``to enrich the class of standard parameteric hierarchical models by wandering nonparametrically near (in some sense) the standard class but retaining the linear structure.'' For example, Brunner [@brunner_bayesian_1995] describes Bayesian linear regression models with symmetric unimodal error densities and Kottas and Gelfand [@kottas_bayesian_2001] describe Bayesian semiparametric median regression. 
DeYoreo & Kottas [@deyoreo_bayesian_2020] explore Bayesian nonparametric density regression for ordinal responses by modeling the joint density between the outcome and covariates using latent continuous random variables. In the context of transformation models, Song & Lu [@song_semiparametric_2012] develop a semiparametric transformation nonlinear mixed model which estimates the transformation, $H(\cdot)$, and also incorporates possible nonlinear relationships between $X$ and $\beta$ as well as random effects using Bayesian P-splines. Tang et al. [@tang_semiparametric_2018] describe semiparametric Bayesian analysis for transformation linear mixed models using a similar Bayesian P-spline approach to estimate the transformation with a focus on nonparametric estimation of random effects. For survival outcomes, Mallick & Walker [@mallick_bayesian_2003] describe a linear transformation model for mean survival time where the transformation, $H(\cdot)$ and the error distribution, $F_{\varepsilon}$, are estimated nonparametrically using mixtures of incomplete beta functions and a Pólya tree distribution, respectively. Lin et al. [@lin_semiparametric_2012] detail a semiparametric Bayesian transformation model for median survival. Hanson and colleagues [@damien_surviving_2013;@hanson_bayesian_2007] and the text by Ibrahim et al. [@ibrahim_bayesian_2010] describe other Bayesian nonparametric survival models. Additional details on general Bayesian nonparametric models can be found in the texts by Müller et al. [@muller_bayesian_2015] and Hjort et al. [@hjort_bayesian_2010]

-->

In this paper, we develop Bayesian CPMs for continuous and mixed outcomes. <!--[They are distinguished from other Bayesian semiparametric approaches by their relationship to traditional ordinal regression models? something else?]-->. Bayesian CPMs inherit many of the properties of CPMs estimated using NPMLE and have additional benefits: interpretation using posterior probabilities, the ability to incorporate available prior information, and inference <!--when the log-likelihood is not well-approximated by a quadratic function [!! need to show example where this is the case in simulations]-->
for quantities of interest without using asymptotic approximations.
A primary challenge when implementing Bayesian CPMs for continuous outcomes is the specification of priors for the intercept parameters and we describe several proposed strategies. Through simulations, we explore characteristics of Bayesian CPMs using several model specifications and prior combinations<!--and make comparisons to CPM estimates using NPMLE and Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) regression, another popular approach for flexibly modeling outcomes-->. We present a case study involving HIV biomarker data for which the outcomes are skewed and censored at a lower limit of detection. We conclude with a discussion -- including advantages, current limitations, and extensions -- and recommendations for using Bayesian CPMs.

# Methods

## Cumulative Probability Model formulation
<!-- see Albert & Chib 1997 - sec 2, and Johnson & Albert Ordinal Data Modeling to clean up this section-->
Let $Y_i$ be the outcome for unit $i=1,\ldots,n$ with $p$ associated covariates $\boldsymbol{X_i}=(X_{i1},\ldots,X_{ip})$ such that each $Y_i$ falls into one of $j=1,\ldots, J$ ordered categories. The $Y_i$ can be modeled using a $Categorical(\boldsymbol{\pi_i})$ -- or $Multinomial(1,\boldsymbol{\pi_i})$ -- distribution where $\boldsymbol{\pi_i}=(\pi_{i1}, \ldots, \pi_{iJ})$ are the probabilities of unit $i$ being in category $j$ and $\sum_{j=1}^{J}\pi_{ij}=1$. The value of $\pi_{ij}$ is dependent on $x_i$, but we suppress the conditional notation except where it is needed for clarity. The cumulative probability of falling into category $j$ or a lower category is $Pr(Y_i \le j)=\eta_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^{j}\pi_{ik}$. A CPM relates the cumulative probabilities to the observed covariates through a monotonically increasing link function $G^{-1}(\eta_{ij})=\gamma_{j}-\boldsymbol{x_i'\beta}$ or equivalently
\begin{gather}
Pr(Y \le j|X,\beta,\gamma)=\eta_{ij}=G(\gamma_{j}-\boldsymbol{x_i'\beta})
\end{gather}
Where the $\gamma_j$ are ordered continuous intercept parameters $-\infty \equiv \gamma_0 < \gamma_1 < \cdots < \gamma_{J-1} <\gamma_J \equiv \infty$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of $p$ coefficients.
For identifiability, the linear predictor $\boldsymbol{x_i'\beta}$ does not include an intercept, $\beta_0$. Common choices for $G^{-1}(\cdot)$ are logit, $G^{-1}(p)=\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$; probit, $G^{-1}(p)=\Phi^{-1}(p)$; and loglog, $G^{-1}(p)=-\log(-\log(p))$. The conditional probabilities of category membership are
\begin{gather}
\label{eq:cellprobs}
\pi_{ij}=\eta_{i,j}-\eta_{i,j-1}=G(\gamma_j-\boldsymbol{x_i'\beta})-G(\gamma_{j-1}-\boldsymbol{x_i'\beta})
\end{gather}
Where the function $G(\cdot)$ is a CDF defined as the inverse of the link function: standard logistic, standard normal, and standard Gumbel for the logit, probit, and loglog links, respectively. The likelihood for an iid sample of observations $(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ is
\begin{gather}
p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta})=
\prod_{j=1}^{J}\prod_{i:y_i=j}[G(\gamma_j-\boldsymbol{x_i'\beta})-G(\gamma_{j-1}-\boldsymbol{x_i'\beta})]
\end{gather}
For continuous data with no ties $J=n$. Letting $r(y_i)$ be the rank of $y_i$ the likelihood reduces to
\begin{gather}
p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta})=
\prod_{i=1}^{n}[G(\gamma_{r(y_i)}-\boldsymbol{x_i'\beta})-G(\gamma_{r(y_i)-1}-\boldsymbol{x_i'\beta})]
\end{gather}

To complete the model specification we define priors for the parameters $p(\boldsymbol{\beta},\boldsymbol{\gamma})$. We assume *a priori* independence between $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ so $p(\boldsymbol{\beta},\boldsymbol{\gamma})=p(\boldsymbol{\beta})p(\boldsymbol{\gamma})$. To simplify the model formulation we also assume noninformative priors for the regression coefficients, $p(\boldsymbol{\beta}) \propto \boldsymbol{1}$ however weakly informative or informative priors can also be used. <!--conditional means approach for defining joint prior fro Johnson & ALbert sec 4.2.2 pp 132 -->

Specifying priors for $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ is more challenging because of the ordering restriction. Several approaches have been suggested in the traditional CPM setting where $J \ll n$. McKinley et al. [@mckinley_bayesian_2015] and Congdon [@congdon_bayesian_2005] describe a sequentially truncated prior distribution: $p(\boldsymbol{\gamma})=p(\gamma_1)\prod_{j=2}^{J-1}p(\gamma_i|\gamma_{j-1})$ where the support of $p(\gamma_1)$ is $\mathbb{R}$ and the support of $p(\gamma_j)$ for $j=2,\ldots, J-1$ is $(\gamma_{j-1},\infty)$. For example using normal and truncated normal priors, $p(\gamma_1)\sim N(0, \sigma_\gamma^2)$ and $p(\gamma_j|\gamma_{j-1}) \sim N(0, \sigma_\gamma^2)I(\gamma_{j-1},\infty)$. A second approach described by Albert and Chib [@albert_bayesian_1997] defines the prior on a transformation of the intercepts to an unconstrained space; normalizing $\gamma_0$ to 0 so $0 \equiv \gamma_0 < \gamma_1 < \cdots < \gamma_{J-1} <\gamma_J \equiv \infty$ and letting $\delta_1=\log(\gamma_1)$ and $\delta_j=\log(\gamma_j - \gamma_{j-1}),\, 2 \le j \le J-1$ a multivariate prior can be assigned, e.g. $\boldsymbol{\delta} \sim N_{J-1}(\boldsymbol{\mu_0},\boldsymbol{\Sigma_0})$.
Both approaches provide priors that satisfy the ordering restriction, but may be cumbersome when the number of distinct continuous data values is high. The first requires specification of the distribution and its hyperparameters, then sampling from the sequential series of $J-2$ truncated distributions; the second requires specification of the $J-1$ dimensional $\boldsymbol{\mu_0}$ vector and the $J-1 \times J-1$ covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma_0}$.


We instead adopt a third approach which defines a prior on $\boldsymbol{\pi_i}$ for a prespecified covariate vector and utilizes the transformation defined by $G(\cdot)$ to induce a prior on the $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ [@betancourt_ordinal_2019].
Let $\pi_{.j} \equiv Pr(r(y)=j|x=0)$ be the probability of being in category $j$ when all covariates are 0 (or at their mean values if covariates have been centered) and $\boldsymbol{\pi_{.}}=(\pi_{.1},\ldots,\pi_{.J})$. From equation (\ref{eq:cellprobs}) it follows that
\begin{gather}
\pi_{.j}=G(\gamma_j-0)-G(\gamma_{j-1}-0)=G(\gamma_j)-G(\gamma_{j-1})
\end{gather}
These equations define a transformation $h(\boldsymbol{\gamma})=\boldsymbol{\pi_{.}}$ between the intercept parameters and probabilities of category membership when $\boldsymbol{X}=\boldsymbol{0}$. Conversely,
\begin{gather}
\sum_{k=1}^{j}\pi_{.k}=\sum_{k=1}^{j}\left[G(\gamma_k)-G(\gamma_{k-1})\right]=G(\gamma_j)
\end{gather}
so $G^{-1}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{j}\pi_{.k}\right)=\gamma_j$ defines the inverse transformation.

Because $\boldsymbol{y}$ has a multinomial distribution a conjugate Dirichlet distribution with hyperparameters $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is a natural choice of prior for $\boldsymbol{\pi_{.}}$. Setting $p(\boldsymbol{\pi_{.}}|\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \propto \prod_{j=1}^{J}\pi_{.j}^{\alpha_j-1}$ the posterior distribution is
\begin{align}
p(\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}) & \propto p(\boldsymbol{\gamma})p(\boldsymbol{\beta}) p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta})\\
&\propto p(h(\boldsymbol{\gamma}))|\mathcal{J}|p(\boldsymbol{\beta}) p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta})\\
\label{eq:post}
&\propto p(\boldsymbol{\pi_{\cdot}}|\boldsymbol{\alpha})|\mathcal{J}|p(\boldsymbol{\beta}) p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta})
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{J}$ is the Jacobian of the transformation $h(\boldsymbol{\gamma})=\boldsymbol{\pi_{.}}$. Letting $\Omega=\sum_{j=1}^J\pi_{.j}=1$ be the constraint that all category probabilites sum to 1, the entries in $\mathcal{J}$ where $\mathcal{J}_{r,c}$ is the term in row $r$ and column $c$ are
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{J}_{j,1}=\frac{\partial \pi_{.j}}{\partial \Omega}=1 \quad
\mathcal{J}_{j+1,j+1}=\frac{\partial \pi_{.j+1}}{\partial \gamma_j}=\frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma_j}\left[G(\gamma_{j+1})-G(\gamma_{j})\right]=-g(\gamma_j) \quad
\mathcal{J}_{j,j+1}=\frac{\partial \pi_{.j}}{\partial \gamma_j}=\frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma_j}\left[G(\gamma_{j})-G(\gamma_{j-1})\right]=g(\gamma_j)
\end{equation*}
Where $j=1,\ldots,J-1$, $g(\cdot)$ is the pdf of the distribution $G(\cdot)$, and $\mathcal{J}_{r,c}=0$ for all other entries; the form of the Jacobian is

While it is possible to define separate $\alpha_j$ parameters for each category, we restrict our attention to symmetric Dirichlet distributions which use a single $\alpha$ value for all categories (i.e., $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \cdots = \alpha_J$). The symmetric Dirichlet prior on $\boldsymbol{\pi_{.}}$ along with the transformation $h(\cdot)$ induces a prior for the $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ with $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ controlling the concentration of the induced prior. Figure \@ref(fig:probit-induced) shows induced $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ priors assuming a probit link for several combinations of concentration parameter and number of categories. The priors are approximately distributed around the intercepts that result under an assumption of equal probability for all categories when $\boldsymbol{\beta}=\boldsymbol{0}$; that is, for $J=n$ the values $G^{-1}(\sum_{k=1}^j 1/n)=G^{-1}(j/n)=\hat{\gamma}_{j|X=0}$. <!--multinomial-Dirichlet in sec 3.4 of BDA3 -->The choices correspond to several options for a multinomial-Dirichlet model [@gelman_bayesian_2014]: a uniform Dirichlet ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1$), the multivariate Jeffrey's prior ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/2$), an overall objective prior recommended by Berger et al. [@berger_overall_2015] ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$), and two additional reciprocal formulas ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/(2+(J/3))$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/(0.8+0.35J)$). As the number of categories increases the fixed $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ priors more strongly favor intercepts assuming equal probability for all categories; the reciprocal priors are adjusted to maintain the same degree of concentration relative to the equal probability intercepts.

In multiparameter models, the choice of reference prior depends on the parameter or statistic of interest (e.g. $\beta$, conditional CDF, conditional mean) [@berger_overall_2015].  Without prior information, we seek a value of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ with minimal impact on inference for a variety of settings and quantities of interest while still producing posterior estimates that can be well sampled by the MCMC algorithm.

For the case study, we evaluate convergence of each model using $\hat{R}$ scale reduction factor [@gelman_bayesian_2014] and traceplots of MCMC draws. Model comparison is performed using the difference in expected log predictive density (elpd) calculated using leave-one-out (loo) cross-validation [@vehtari_practical_2017]. Model fit is assessed using graphical checks the of posterior predictive and posterior predictive p-values [@stern_bayesian_2005; @gelman_bayesian_2014].

### Posterior Conditional Quantities

<!--
description of how to use Bayesian CPM to get parameter ests. for shifts in distribution and other quantities of interest, e.g. conditional CDF Mean, Quantiles, using a single model
-->

Using MCMC samples from the posterior distribution ($\tilde{\gamma}$, $\tilde{\beta}$) it is straightforward to calculate the posterior conditional CDF, mean, quantiles or other functions of the parameters

- Posterior conditional CDF:  $\tilde{F}(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i)=G(\tilde{\gamma}_{r(y_i)}-\boldsymbol{x}_i^{T}\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}})$

- Posterior conditional mean:
$\tilde{E}[Y|\boldsymbol{x}_i]=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i\tilde{f}(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i)$ where $\tilde{f}(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i)=\tilde{F}(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i)-\tilde{F}(y_{i-1}|\boldsymbol{x}_i)$

mean only makes sense with continuous data, data below or above a detection limit do not have a known value of $y_i$ that can be used in this calculation without making additional assumptions about the distribution

- Posterior conditional quantile:
To estimate the $q^{th}$ quantile
  - Find $y_i=\inf\{y:\tilde{F}(y|x)\ge q\}$ and the next smallest value $y_{i-1}$
  - Use linear interpolation to find quantile $y_q$ where $y_{i-1}<y_q<y_i$

## Simulations

To evaluate the <!--long-run frequency--> properties of the Bayesian CPM we generate data from several simulation models:
\begin{align*}
1.\; Y&=\exp(X_1\beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + \varepsilon) \quad \varepsilon \sim N(0,1)\\
2.\; Y&=\exp(X_1\beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + \varepsilon) \quad \varepsilon \sim Logistic(0,1/3)\\
3.\; Y&=X_1\beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + \varepsilon \quad \varepsilon \sim Gumbel(0,1)
\end{align*}
where $\beta_1=1$, $\beta_2=-0.5$, $X_1 \sim Bernoulli(0.5)$ and $X_2 \sim N(0,1)$

For each model a second set of simulations was used to evaluate a mixed discrete/continuous outcome such as a lower limit of detection. For the first two models values of $Y<1$ to were set to 1 and for the third model values of $Y<0$ were set to 0. The continuous and censored outcome data based on 1. and 3. were evaluated using a Bayesian CPM with the properly specified probit and loglog links, respectively. For the data based on 2. a logit link Bayesian CPM (which implies $\varepsilon \sim Logistic(0,1)$) was used. In each of the six outcome models, three $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ concentration hyperparameters ($1/J$, $1/(2+(J/3))$, $1/(0.8+0.35J)$) were considered for $p(\boldsymbol{\pi_{.}}|\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ for a total of 18 model and prior combinations. For each combination $1,000$ datasets were generated for sample sizes $n=25,50,100,200$ and $400$.

For scenario (1), we examine the average percent bias [! change this to average bias] of the posterior median for parameters $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ and five $\gamma_j$ parameters corresponding to $y$ values spaced across the range of the data, $\boldsymbol{y}=\{y_1=e^{-1},y_2=e^{-0.33},y_3=e^{0.5},y_4=e^{1.33},y_5=e^2\}$. For the censored outcomes, estimates are only available for the uncensored values of $\boldsymbol{y}$. We also calculate average percent bias of the conditional CDF for $\boldsymbol{y}$ when $X_1=1$ and $X_2=1$, and the conditional median, mean and 20$^{th}$ percentile at $(X_1=1,X_2=1)$ and $(X_1=1,X_2=0)$.

For scenarios (2) and (3), we examine the average bias for $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ and five $\gamma_j$ parameters at $\boldsymbol{y}=\{y_1=e^{-0.5},y_2=e^{0},y_3=e^{0.5},y_4=e^{1},y_5=e^{1.5}\}$ for (2) and $\boldsymbol{y}=\{y_1=-0.3,y_2=0,y_3=0.5,y_4=1.5,y_5=2.5\}$ for (3).  We also calculate the average percent bias of the conditional CDF for $\boldsymbol{y}$ when $X_1=1$ and $X_2=1$, and the conditional median, mean 20$^{th}$ percentile, and 80$^{th}$ percentile at $(X_1=1,X_2=0)$ and $(X_1=1,X_2=1)$.

## Case Study

<!-- Use HIV data from Dr. Koethe. Describe background, data and modeling approach -->

The data for the case study were collected from 216 HIV-positive adults on antiretroviral therapy in two cohort studies. Further details on the study design and cohorts are provided in Koethe et al. [@koethe_serum_2012; @koethe_metabolic_2015]. Because people living with HIV have increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the aim of the analysis is to estimate the association between body mass index (BMI) and several inflammation biomarkers in this population, adjusting for additional covariates: age, sex, race, smoking status, study location and CD4 cell count.

The biomarkers of interest are Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1$\beta$). Both biomarkers are skewed with values censored below a lower limit of detection set to 0. To account for skewness and censoring we fit Bayesian CPM models using logit, probit, and loglog link functions, noninformative $\beta$ priors and a concentration parameter of $\alpha=1/n$ for the Dirichlet distribution to estimate the association between BMI and the conditional mean, median, and 90th quantile of each biomarker.

In general, the Bayesian CPM had reasonable performance under the simulation settings explored; this is especially true for larger sample sizes. However, performance was poor for some quantities. The three $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ values produced similar results for most scenarios.

### Parameters

For scenario (1) using a probit link CPM, the average percent bias in the posterior median for $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\gamma_{y_k}$ are shown in figures \@ref(fig:simplt-pars1) and \@ref(fig:simplt-pars2) for the uncensored and censored outcome data, respectively. Across both outcomes, the estimates of $\beta_1$ and all $\gamma$s were larger using the $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$ concentration prior compared to the $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/(0.8+0.35J)$ or $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/(2+(J/3))$ concentration priors while the $\beta_2$ estimates were smaller with $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$. Percent bias was largest for the smallest sample sizes, but the direction and size of the bias depends on the outcome, concentration prior and parameter. For the $\beta$ parameters, the priors $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/(0.8+0.35J)$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/(2+(J/3))$ produce less biased estimates than $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$ for both outcomes. The situation is more complex for the $\gamma$ parameters. With the uncensored outcome, the $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$ prior estimate is less biased for $\gamma_{y_1}$ and $\gamma_{y_2}$, but more biased for $\gamma_{y_3}$, $\gamma_{y_4}$, and $\gamma_{y_5}$; with the censored outcome, the $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$ prior estimate is less biased for $\gamma_{y_3}$, but more biased for $\gamma_{y_4}$ and $\gamma_{y_5}$.

```


Figures \@ref(fig:simplt-pars3) and \@ref(fig:simplt-pars4) show the average bias in the posterior median for $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\gamma_{y_k}$ for scenario (2) using a logit link CPM. Unlike scenario (1), the assumed scale of the logit link ($\varepsilon \sim Logistic(0,1)$) does not match the scale from the simulation model ($\varepsilon \sim Logistic(0,1/3)$). In this case it can be shown that the CPM parameter estimates are proportional to the parameters from the generating model. Assume latent $Y^*=\beta'X + a\varepsilon$ where $a>0$ is a constant scaling factor with $\varepsilon \sim F_{\varepsilon}$ assumed known, and observed $Y=H(Y^*)$ with increasing function $H(t)$. Then $Y=H(\beta'X+a\varepsilon)=H'(\xi'X+\varepsilon)$ where $\xi=a^{-1}\beta$ and $H'(t)=H(at)$ so $Pr(Y \le y|X)=Pr(H'(\xi'X+\varepsilon)\le y|X)=F_{\varepsilon}(H'^{-1}(y)-\xi'X)$. Using a CPM with link function $F_{\varepsilon}^{-1}$ to analyze the observed outcome $Y$ results in estimates of $\xi=a^{-1}\beta$ for the linear predictor coefficients and $H'^{-1}=a^{-1}H^{-1}$ for the intercept function. In this sense, the parameter estimates are biased because they are on the incorrect scale. If the estimates are adjusted using the scale factor, $a$, the bias in the parameters follows a similar pattern as scenario (1) (make fig?). However in practice, the value of the scale factor is unknown.

For scenario (3) using the correctly specified loglog link with an identity transformation, bias is small for all parameters for both uncensored and censored outcomes except with the $n=25$ sample size. The estimates using prior $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$ are slightly more biased than the other concentration priors. (See supplemental figures \@ref(fig:simplt-pars5) and \@ref(fig:simplt-pars6)).

```


### Conditional CDF

Figures \@ref(fig:simplt-cdf1) and \@ref(fig:simplt-cdf2) show the average percent bias in the posterior conditional CDF for scenario (1). For the uncensored outcome, the conditional CDF estimates of $F(y|X_1=1,X_2=1)$ have larger percent bias when $y<e^{0.5}$, especially for the smallest sample sizes, $n=25$ and $n=50$. For conditional CDF estimates at $y<e^{0.5}$, the concentration prior $\alpha=1/J$ produces estimates that are slightly more biased than the othe reciprocal priors. The direction of the bias does not show a consistent trend across sample size. Similar patterns are seen for the the censored outcome, less biased estimates for the CDF at higher $y$ values and larger sample sizes. The results are similar for scenario (2) and (3) under both outcomes: larger percent bias for the conditional estimates of $F(y|X_1=1,X_2=1)$ for lower values of $y$ and smaller sample sizes (supplemental figs. \@ref(fig:simplt-cdf3), \@ref(fig:simplt-cdf4), \@ref(fig:simplt-cdf5), and \@ref(fig:simplt-cdf6)).

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(wd,"fig","sim_b_cdf_cens.png"))
```

### Conditional Mean

Figures \@ref(fig:simplt-mn1) and \@ref(fig:simplt-mn3) present the average percent bias in the posterior conditional mean for the uncensored simulation outcome at $(X_1=1,X_2=0)$ and $(X_1=1,X_2=1)$ in scenarios (1) and (2), respectively. The average percent bias across was less than 5\% for all sample sizes and priors for the posterior conditional mean in the first two scenarios. For scenario (3) the average percent bias across all simulations ranged from $<-1.0$\% to -12.5\% with larger bias for the $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$ prior (fig. \@ref(fig:simplt-mn5)). In contrast, figures \@ref(fig:simplt-mn2) and \@ref(fig:simplt-mn4) show the posterior conditional mean estimates for the censored data. For outcomes censored at $Y<1$, a value of $Y=1$ was used in the conditional mean calculation. Using the censoring threshold value for censored observations can result in inflated average percent bias compared to the uncensored case depending on where the threshold falls in relation to the true conditional distribution and the value chosen for censored observations. A similar trend was seen in scenario (3) where a value of $Y=0$ was used to calculate the conditional mean for outcomes censored at $Y<0$ (fig \@ref(fig:simplt-mn6)).

```

### Conditional Median and Quantiles

The results for the conditional posterior median are shown in figures \@ref(fig:simplt-med1) and \@ref(fig:simplt-med2). For both outcomes, the conditional median estimate had a positive bias for both $(X_1=1,X_2=0)$ and $(X_1=1,X_2=1)$ with smaller bias for larger sample sizes. There were negligible differences in average percent bias of the median estimates for the three $\alpha$ concentration parameters. The pattern was nearly identical for scenario (2) (figs. \@ref(fig:simplt-med3) and \@ref(fig:simplt-med4)). For both outcomes under scenario (3), bias in the conditional median estimate was smaller at $(X_1=1,X_2=0)$ than $(X_1=1,X_2=1)$. There were only small differences in average percent bias of the median estimates for the three $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ concentration parameters (\@ref(fig:simplt-med5) and \@ref(fig:simplt-med6)). 

Figure \@ref(fig:simplt-q20-1) presents the results for the posterior conditional 20th percentile in the uncensored simulation data in scenario (1). The estimates are quite biased for the smaller sample sizes. The magnitude of the bias also varies based on the values of the conditioning variables, $X_1$ and $X_2$ with larger bias when the the conditional distribution is further from $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$. The estimates of the conditional 20th percentile for the censored outcome in scenario (1) (fig. \@ref(fig:simplt-q20-2)) show a similar effect as the censored outcome. When $(X_1=1,X_2=1)$ the true conditional $Q^{0.2}$ falls below the censoring threshold so the estimated $Q^{0.2}$ is the value assigned to the censored category. This value is biased even with large sample size. For scenario (2) the estimates of the posterior conditional 20th percentile with the uncensored outcome are positively biased for the smaller sample sizes with more bias for the $\alpha=1/J$ concentration prior (figure \@ref(fig:simplt-q20-3)). The estimates of the conditional 20th percentile for the censored outcome (fig. \@ref(fig:simplt-q20-4)) show a similar trend as the censored outcome. Under scenario (3) the uncensored outcome estimates of the conditional 20th percentile are close to unbiased for all the priors and sample sizes (fig. \@ref(fig:simplt-q20-5)) and the censored outcome estimates (fig. \@ref(fig:simplt-q20-6)) show smaller bias at $(X_1=1,X_2=0)$ than $(X_1=1,X_2=1)$.

Figures \@ref(fig:simplt-q80-3) and \@ref(fig:simplt-q80-4) present the estimates of the conditional 80th percentile for the uncensored and censored outcomes. Similar to the 20th percentile estimates, the estimates are positively biased for smaller sample sizes. But in contrast, the estimates using the $\alpha=1/J$ concentration prior are *less* biased compared to the other priors. Figures \@ref(fig:simplt-q80-5) and \@ref(fig:simplt-q80-6)) present the estimates of the conditional 80th percentile for the uncensored and censored outcomes.

### Computation time

Simulations were run with `R` version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) and `rstan` (Version 2.19.2, GitRev: 2e1f913d3ca3) on a high-performance computing cluster running under CentOS Linux 7 (Core) with with 1.90GHz or 2.40GHz Intel Xeon CPUs. Computation time for the three scenarios is shown in figures \@ref(fig:simplt-samptime1), \@ref(fig:simplt-samptime3), and \@ref(fig:simplt-samptime4). Average per chain sampling time was similar across scenarios and priors. The censored outcomes -- with fewer categories and $\gamma$ parameters -- had shorter sampling times.

## Case Study

For each of the biomarker outcomes four model specifications were fit: probit link with $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$, probit link with $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/(0.8+0.35J)$,
logit link with $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$, and logit link with $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/(0.8+0.35J)$. Each model sampled from 2 chains with 2000 warmup iterations and 4000 total iterations to produce 4000 posterior draws for each parameter. [add adapt_delta set to 0.95?]. For all the biomarker outcome models considered, all $\hat{R}$ values were $<1.01$ and traceplots (not shown, add to supp??) indicated no problems with mixing or stationarity. Tables \ref{tab:elpdtab1} and \ref{tab:elpdtab2} show the difference in ELPD for the four models for biomarker IL-6 and IL-1-$\beta$, respectively. Based on the difference in ELPD, the model using logit link and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/J$ was used for the IL-6 outcome and the model using probit link and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=1/(0.8+0.35J)$ was used for the IL-1-$\beta$ outcome.

# Discussion

Bayesian CPMs are a versatile modeling approach with many advantages:

- Avoid specification of outcome transformation
- handle continuous and discrete ordered outcomes
- estimate full conditional CDF, quantiles and mean using a single model fit
- provide inference without asymptotic assumptions

## Limitations


- assumes parallelism (constant difference between transformed conditional CDFs, i.e. proportional odds assumption if using logit link or proportional hazards assumption for cloglog), however less
- The number of distinct outcome values must be known *a priori*, that is we condition on $J$ categories. In practice, the number of distinct continuous outcome values is unlikely to be known before data collection, so this formulation violates the principle that the prior should be specified without reference to the observed data. For this same reason, the model cannot accomodate new observations so is not useful for Bayesian updating or adaptive designs. In other words, once the initial prior is set the posterior from an initial model cannot serve as the prior for a model with additional data points because there is no way to add categories. <!-- Some discussion of extensions using  e.g. Dirichlet process mixture or Polya trees (ref semiparameteric surv. analysis papers?) -->
- The choice of link function, and the implied error distribution on the scale of the untransformed data is also assumed to be known. As was seen in the simulations, misspecification of the link function can lead to large bias.

- For both the Bias for small $n$
- Computation time

## Extensions

- nonparametric priors, e.g. Dirichlet process mixture or Polya trees
- partial proportional odds
- relaxation of link function specification

<!--

## Extending the CPM model

* Mixture link
-Not sure if mixture link is needed to fit model well. Evidence from previous papers and CPM poster show ok robustness, except for extreme link misspecification

One important component of the CPM is the specification of the link function $F(\cdot)$. Although the CPM model estimated using NPMLE is somewhat robust to link function misspecification it is of interest to determine the degree to which the data support one link function over another. In the Bayesian model, we can model a mixture of several link functions while incorporating the additional uncertainty inherent in allowing a combination of multiple links.

Consider both finite mixture $F_{mix}=w_1F_1 + w_2F_2 + (1-w_1-w_2)F_3$ and BNP prior over normal distributions to get nonparametric estimate of link

[need to research more about mixture models]
[add Stan model implementing mixture link]
Let $F_1 \sim loglog$, $F_2 \sim logistic$, $F_3 \sim cloglog$ be three possible choices for link function. Then $F_{mix}=w_1F_1 + w_2F_2 + (1-w_1-w_2)F_3$ is a mixture. The priors for weights $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$ such that $\sum_i w_i = 1$

Incorporating this extension the full model becomes

$p(\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta},\boldsymbol{w}|\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{Y}) \propto p(\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{w})\prod_{i=1}^{n}[F_{mix}(y_i|x_i)-F_{mix}(y_i - |x_i)]$

(do we need to get inverse?, i.e. $F_{mix}^{-1}(\cdot)$)

also consider using some sort of DP prior over normal distributions to get nonparametric estimate of link (lose interpretability and computational efficiency, but might have more robustness). One or the other might be better depending on the sample size, complexity of outcome, etc

* PO, NPO, PPO extension
use selection for PO/NPO by variable -> see McKinley et al. [@mckinley_bayesian_2015]
or location-shift models -> see Tutz and Berger

* Nonlinear model extension -
nonlinear in variables (splines etc) and nonlinear in parameters

* Longitudinal model extension -
nonlinear mixed effects (will eventually be used for PK/PD modeling)
