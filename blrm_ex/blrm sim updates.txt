simulations

1) model misspecified? using normal error, but fitting with logistic link

2) with default draws what is MCMC simulation error for intercept coefs? are diffs just due to sim error

3) compare posterior mode coef(b,stat='mode') to MLE from lrm()

4) got some warning messages after running through the simulation loops
add checks for convergence, etc of models in simulations

5) why use closeness to MLE to determine prior?

either smallest prior or
prior based on minimizing contrib from dirichlet & Jacobian
should be closest to MLE

not clear why this is best
